# **AI Ne Bola** üåü

AI Ne Bola is a comprehensive project that predicts the number of death cases, case fatality ratio (CFR), and other related metrics for various scenarios using machine learning models. It also provides detailed 3D visualizations and interactive web interfaces for users to explore the predictions.

## **Project Overview**

### **Live Links**  
- **Home Page:** [https://ai-ne-bola.netlify.app/](https://ai-ne-bola.netlify.app/)  
  This website offers a detailed view of the project and its purpose.  
- **Prediction Backend:** [https://ai-ne-bola-pvt.onrender.com/](https://ai-ne-bola-pvt.onrender.com/)  
  This backend predicts death cases and CFR using external parameters like temperature and humidity.

## **Repository Structure**

### üìÅ `Website_Files`  
Contains the files used to host the homepage: **[https://ai-ne-bola.netlify.app/](https://ai-ne-bola.netlify.app/)**.  
Explore the project overview and interact with the user-friendly interface here.

---

### üìÅ `backend_predict`  
Houses the backend files used for predictions.  
- **Deployed at:** [https://ai-ne-bola-pvt.onrender.com/](https://ai-ne-bola-pvt.onrender.com/)  
- Predicts:
  - **Number of Death Cases**
  - **Case Fatality Ratio (CFR)**  
  - Considers **external parameters** like temperature and humidity for accurate predictions.

---

### üìÅ `graph_plots`  
Contains Python scripts for generating **3D visualizations** of death cases and the number of cases based on longitude and latitude.  
- Key Features:
  - **Interactive 3D plots** for better visualization.
  - Visual insights into the spread and impact of cases.

---

### üìÅ `predict`  
This directory includes:  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
- **Prediction Analysis**:
  - Plots for **Predicted Cases vs. Actual Cases**.
  - Mean Square Error (MSE) to evaluate model accuracy (**very low** in our case).  
- **Example Implementation**:
  - Sampled longitude and latitude for verifying predictions.

---

### üìÑ `test_points.csv`  
This file contains the data predicted using our model . It contains the test points along with paremeters number of death cases, CFR and total cases.  
- Format: **CSV**  
- Includes essential data points like longitude, latitude, and other parameters.

---

### üìÑ `main.py`
This file is the building block of our model , all our mathematical assumptions like temperature dependency , prediction of unreported regions are done here.
So the whole prediction process has been done in this file.
